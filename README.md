# SELECTION-SORT
## AIM: To get an array of random integers from user and sort it using Selection Sort
## ALGORITHM:
1) Start
2) In main file, initialize an array "a[n]"
3) Get the array size and store it in 'n'.
4) Use For loop to get input from user to store random integers in the declared array 'a'.
5) Using anothe for loop print the user defined array.
6) In function file,define a function 'ss' with paramaters as array A and one integer N.
7) 	for(j=i+1;j<N-1;j++){
			if(A[i]>A[j])
      swap A[i] with A[j]
8) print the sorted array using for loop. 

Description:
This program selects one element of the array at a time and then compare it with rest all the elements and then places it in such a way that its the greatest in magnitude. Then the program selects another element and the same process repeats until the whole array is sorted in ascending order.
